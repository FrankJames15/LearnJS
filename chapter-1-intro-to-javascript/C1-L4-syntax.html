      <h1>Syntax</h1>
      <p>
        In this lesson weâ€™ll learn about JavaScript syntax including comments,
        statements and case-sensitivity
      </p>

      <!-- Comments -->
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>
        Comments are used to make programming easier to read and understand. It
        can be used to add notes, suggestions and hints to JavaScript code
      </p>
      <p>Comments are not executed by the browser</p>
      <p>There are 2 types of comments, the single line and the multi-line</p>
      <p>Single line comments start with <code>//</code></p>
      <pre class="shadow p-4">// This is a single line comment</pre>
      <br />
      <p>
        Multi-line comments goes between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>
      </p>
      <pre class="shadow p-4">
/*
* This is a 
* Muti-line comment
*/</pre
      >
      <br />
      <!-- Statements -->
      <h3 class="mb-2">Statements</h3>
      <p>
        A JavaScript statement is a command to a browser. The purpose of the
        command is to tell the browser what to do.
      </p>
      <pre class="shadow p-4">
document.write("Hello Student");
// this JavaScript statement tells the browser 
// to write "Hello Student" to the web page
      </pre>
      <p>
        The semicolon is optional. the browser is supposed to interpret the end
        of the line as the end of the statement. <br />
        Therefore, semicolon can be omitted if each of your statements are
        placed on a separate line. <br /><br />
        For example, the following code could be written without semicolons
      </p>
      <pre class="shadow p-4">
document.write("Hello World")
document.write("Hello Student")</pre
      >

      <p>
        But when formatted in a single line as follows, we must use semicolon:
      </p>
      <pre class="shadow p-4">
document.write("Hello World"); document.write("Hello Student")</pre
      >
      <br />
      <div class="alert alert-success">
        Using semicolons makes it possible to write multiple statements on one
        line
      </div>
      <p>
        Although JavaScript does not require to end a statement with a semicolon
        (;), it is recommended to always use the semicolon to end a statement to
        make our code more readable and avoid many issues that we may encounter
      </p>
      <p>Following points must be noted regarding JavaScript statements</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          JavaScript statements are executed in the order in which they are
          written
        </li>
        <li>Mutiple line spaces in statement are ignored</li>
        <li>Statements are separated by semicolon(;) at the end</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <!-- Case Sensitivity -->
      <h3 class="mb-2">Case Sensitivity</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is case sensitive - therefore watch your capitalization
        closely when you write JavaScript statements
      </p>
      <p>
        If we mistakenly type <code>Document.Write</code> instead of <code>document.write</code> this
        statement will throw an error as it did not convey the same meaning to
        the browser
      </p>
      <br />

      <!-- Expression -->
      <h3 class="mb-2">Expression</h3>
      <p>An expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value></p>
      <pre class="shadow p-4">2 + 1 //Output: 3</pre>
      <p>The above expression returns 3 to it is valid expression.</p>
      <br />
