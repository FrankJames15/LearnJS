        <h1>Storing a Number</h1>
        <p>Let’s say we want to store our age in a variable and print it.</p>
        <p>
          We would to this by first storing the age in a variable followed by
          printing it out.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s start by creating a variable.</p>
        <pre class="shadow p-4">var age = 22;</pre>
        <p>
          Mind you, <code>age</code> and <code>Age</code> will be 2 different variables because JavaScript
          is a <strong>case-sensitive</strong> language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Few points to keep in mind while creating variable with number as a
          value:
        </p>
        <p>Numbers can be written with or without decimal.</p>
        <pre class="shadow p-4">
var without_decimal = 10;
var with_decimal = 11.07;</pre
        >
        <div class="shadow alert alert-warning">
          Numbers are always numeric values written without quotations (””) as
          we already know, only strings are written with quotations.
        </div>
      </div>
