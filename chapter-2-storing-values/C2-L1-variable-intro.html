          <h1>Storing Value</h1>
          <p>
            Now, let’s dive deeper and learn how to store values in JavaScript
            <br /><br />
            Imagine yourself as a scientist in a chemistry lab. <br />
            So, if you look around the lab, you’ll find several cylinders Each
            cylinder contains different types of gases, starting from oxygen to
            nitrogen <br /><br />
            But how do we differentiate which cylinder contains which gas?
            <br /><br />
            To solve this problem, we get it <strong>labelled</strong> with the
            gas’ <strong>name</strong> on it. <br /><br />
            Similarly, if we want to <strong>store</strong> some information, we
            <strong>store</strong> in our memory. And we’ve all the information
            labelled in order to avoid confusion. If someone asks our age, we
            don’t tell them our grandfather’s name. Do we? Definitely no!
          </p>
          <div class="shadow alert alert-info">
            In Programming, this <strong>storing container</strong> is called
            <strong>“Variable”</strong>.
          </div>

          <p>
            So, variables are <strong>container</strong> which
            <strong>store values</strong>. We place <strong>values</strong> in
            these containers and then use those values by referring to the
            container’s name.
