        <h1>Creating a Function</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>What's a Function?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>Function</strong> is a block of reusable code which can be
          used anywhere in the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main aim of a function is to eliminate the need of writing the
          same code again and again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like if we can create function which would perform addition, we can
          call it several times to perform the same task rather than writing
          separate codes whenever we want to perfrom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we know what a function is, let's go ahead and learn how to
          create one.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- How to create a function? -->
        <h2>How to create a function?</h2>
        <p>A function can only be used when it is called.</p>
        <p>
          Until and unless we call the function which adds numbers, the function
          will sit ideally being jobless.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the first step is function definition, which basically means to
          define the function i,e. to create a function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we're done defining the function, the next step is to call and
          use it.
        </p>
        <p>Don't worry, we will learn each and every step.</p>
        <p>Let's start with the first one.</p>
        <p>A function can be defined in the following way:</p>
        <pre class="shadow p-4">
function functionName() {
    code;
}</pre
        >
        <p>
          We start defining the function by using the function keyword followed
          by the name of the function which is then followed by open and close
          roud brackets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we're done with it, we write the reusable code inside the curly
          brackets.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- Function Example. -->
        <h2>Function Example</h2>

        <p>Let's create a function which prints "I know JavaScript!"</p>
        <p>
          We'll start by writing the function keyword followed by naming the
          function and opening and closing the roud brackets
        </p>
        <pre class="shadow p-4">function print()</pre>
        <p>We've named our function as print.</p>
        <p>
          Once we're done with it let's write the code to print inside curly
          brackets.
        </p>
        <pre class="shadow p-4">
function print() {
    console.log("I know JavaScript");
}</pre
        >
        <br />

        <!-- Calling a Function -->
        <h2>Calling a Function</h2>
        <p>
          Now, we've a function named print which prints "I know JavaScript".
        </p>
        <p>The next step is calling the function.</p>
        <p>
          Calling a function is as easy as writing the name of the function
          followed by opening and closing round brackets.
        </p>
        <p>So, the whole code would look something like:</p>
        <pre class="shadow p-4">
function print() {
    console.log("I know JavaScript");
}
print();</pre
        >
      </div>
    </main>
